# Captain's Weather App

🌤️ **Captain's Weather App** is a simple web application built using Flask that allows users to search for and view weather details for any city by providing its name and country code.

  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Wind speed
  - Sunrise and sunset times
  - General weather conditions (e.g., Rain, Clear, Clouds)
- Responsive and visually appealing UI using Bootstrap 5.
- Search weather by city name and country code.
- Displays formatted date and time information.
